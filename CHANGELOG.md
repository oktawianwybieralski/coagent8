## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-10-05 ([`v1.0.0-beta.1`](https://github.com/oktawianwybieralski/coagent8/tree/v1.0.0-beta.1))

### Added
- Canonical tool surface: `consult` (with `task_type`), `review`, `doctor`,
  `session`, `cancel`, `issue`; compact profile through `run`.
- Plain `consult` answers with a structured `verdict` field; the State Envelope is
  enforced for `review` only.
- Generic MCP interoperability: tools are listed without a recognized client and
  without invoking a backend.
- Optional `setup`, `repair` and `status` commands for Codex, Claude Code and agy
  host registration, reused by the VS Code extension.
- Claude Code backend in restricted read-only mode with streaming and resume.
- Claude Code subscription quota read from `/usage` before routing.
- Native Gemini (`agy`) quota inspection in `doctor`.
- Focused test file selection in `tests/run.cjs`.

### Changed
- Session pruning runs in the background after the MCP transport connects.
- Backend resolution no longer writes the default backend to the configuration.
- Hidden PowerShell windows for Windows process supervision and tests.
- License changed to GPL-3.0-only.
- Product and npm package renamed to CoAgent8 (`coagent8`).

### Deprecated
- Tools `analyze`, `debug` and `implement`; use `consult` with `task_type`.
  Removal is planned for v1.1.0.

### Fixed
- Gemini sandbox-denial handling no longer reports valid results as duplicates.
- Escaped and structured Windows home paths are redacted in diagnostics.
- Claude Code events require `init`, `inspectQuota` is version-gated and
  sessions are hardened.
- Adapter startup errors keep their diagnostics; billing failures map to
  authentication errors.
